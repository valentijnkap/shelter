# Shelter

(If you are looking arround, this readme is specially written for my [mentor](https://github.com/wooorm) who made this assignment. I write about my learning proces. Sorry!)

## The story of..
This code is an example of a simple Express server. For an [assignment](https://github.com/cmda-be/course-17-18/tree/master/examples/express-server) I had to fix the example step by step. By doing this I would get familiar with Express.js. The code portraits a shelter website where you can adopt pets. 

## The steps I took

### Serving images
I had to make a route from the images in the `db/image` and give it back as `/image`. So I dived in the docs from Express and found the right example to make that route. I defined the route for the images and used the `static()` function to tell the server where to get it from.

*What I did*
```javascript
.use('/image', express.static('db/image'))
```

### Support the detail view
To make a detail page I had to get all the data from one animal and render it in a detail page. But I didn't knew how on the go. So started to look at the first `GET` request callback and found a way to do it. But I wasn't there yet. To get all the data from the given ID I had to catch it from the given url. I found an example from an [article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-expressjs-to-get-url-and-post-parameters) from Chris Seveilleja. He stored the ID that has been given in the url in a var and used it in the `send()` funtion.

This is how I structed it:

```javascript
function get(req, res, next) {

  // Store the id from the requested url and puts it a var
  var id = req.param('id')

  // Get data by ID from the database
  var result = {errors: [], data: db.get(id)} 

  //Render the resulting data in detail.ejs
  res.render('detail.ejs', Object.assign({}, result, helpers))

}
```

## Deleting content
My next step of the assignment was deleting content based on an id. I looked up the slides and found the first steps. Get the id by `reg.param('id')` and delete it with `db.remove(id)` and send ok response back with json.

*I came up with this:*

```javascript
function remove(req, res) {
	req.param('id')

	db.remove(id)
	res.status(204).json('status: oke')
}

```

That didn't work for me. It gave me errors and I didn't completed the assignment. I should also respond with 404 and 400 when those cases happen. I didn't know how to solve this problem so I found an issue on slack from Deanne who tried to do the same thing. I followed her struggles and tried to understand whats missing. Then I solved the puzzle to do it my why and came up with this:

```javascript
function remove(req, res) {
  var id = req.param('id')
  var data = db.get(id)
  var has

  // Gives internal server error (500) instead of 400
  try {
    has = db.has(id)
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json(id)
    return
  }

  // This does work
  if (data) {
    db.remove(id)
    res.status(204).json(data)
  } else {
    res.status(404).json(id)
  }

}
```

## Actually not done yet...
There are still some things I should fix before I complemented the assignment. But I wil do this some other time.
